Work in progress!

Testing with a to engines running in Chrome using Leaflet and OpenLayers as clients and a set of S-57 charts.

There is a test html in the wms folder of the project. It is using Santa Catalina Island as a reference, US charts US5CA76M, US4CA60M and US3CA70M should do, available from NOAA.


Known Problems:
Small images not rendered properly (messing up scaling)
Zoom causes crashes
Coordinates will be messed up slightly

Sidenote:
