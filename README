This is an attempt to add the ability to act as a WMS Server.

Work in progress!

Testing with a to engines running in Chrome, (Leaflet and OpenLayers)
See the test html in the root as I know what the coordinates are in Southern Denmark - I know what it looks like there :-)

Problems:
Small images not rendered properly (messing up scaling)
Zoom causes crashes
Coordinates will be messed up slightly
