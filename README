This is an attempt to add the ability to act as a WMS Server.

Work in progress!

Testing with a to engines running in Chrome using Leaflet and OpenLayers as clients and a set of S-57 charts.

There is a test html in the root of the project. It is in Southern Denmark (you can just see a glimpse of Germany) - I know what it looks like there :-)
I will switch to whereever OpenCPN normally works.

TODO:
More layers to handle lights etc.
Day Night

Known Problems:
Don't hover over the WMS window (tries to activate not existing menu)
Small images not rendered properly (messing up scaling)
Zoom causes crashes
Coordinates will be messed up slightly

Sidenote:
Could be used for rendering a "view only" set for low power up devices, might try to do that on a small esp32 based 4" thing if I get bored. Just another layer.
